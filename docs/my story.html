    <h1>My story</h1>
    <div class="box">
        <p>
            Since little, my favorite past times would be playing with my legos, sharing stories, solving puzzles and playing
            games. This passion for creative work led me to my bachelor's in communication, arts and media, with the dream to
            share amazing experiences and improve my community.
            <br>
            <br>
            In my first year of my graduation, I came in contact with Python. That first experience led me to develop a deep
            interest in programming and computer science and I started studying game development, learning Unity, C# and 3D
            modeling and design in Blender. I understood then that software development puts everything I loved as child
            together, and I fell in love with it.
            <br>
            <br>
            I was one of the founding students of a new game research and development group in my institute, Gamecine, in which
            I had the opportunity to further my knowledge in game development as well as practicing Git, Scrum and Project
            Management. The first game we made already helped some kids in the community by teaching them how to keep safe in
            the pandemic.
            <br>
            <br>
            I was invited to be a learner at the Apple Developer Academy, where I learned core apple development skills such as
            Swift, Objective-c, SwiftUI, Combine, Core Data, MVC, MVVM, VIPER and use of RESTful APIs. There, I also learned key
            UX/UI skills and got to practice lean businesses strategies with Customer Development, Growth Hacking and Product
            Discovery. I was quickly distinguished by being one of the winning WWDC21 scholars and being elected Ambassador by
            my peers. I've made some amazing, hardworking friends and, together, we launched two apps in the App Store, as a
            means to further our learning.
            <br>
            <br>
            As a Creative, I'm keen to look at the bigger picture and understand that just programming is not enough to be a
            World Class Developer. I'm passionate about Human Centered Design and this helps me immensely in developing better,
            more useable products. I'm also interested in Business and Product Management and I understand that, above all,
            software is just a means to help real people solve their real problems. In such, I know that understanding people is
            the first step to develop a great product.
            <br>
            <br>
            I can say that my specialty is learning, but my background in communication brought me an invaluable skillset in
            Collaboration, Inclusion and Representation. With Empathy, I'm happiest when I can grow along with my peers. And
            this also makes itself present in one of my biggest Hobbies, cooking. In the kitchen, Attention to Detail and
            Innovation are always welcome and rewarded, and are even better when Shared.
